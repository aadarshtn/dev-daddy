Backend server for a social media platform exclusively build for developers


dev-daddy.io is my personal project,
by which I would like to build a hybrid version of stackoverflow and something like twitter(generaly speaking, a normal social media platform where people could follow other people rather than making them connect, which I feel makes things more official).
Basically I want to give developers a more socially interactive life rather than the 14 or 15 inch of led monitors.

upto commit: dc37b7f394aeab85abdebd3a9f1fab2c2f0d76f5
The current version of the back-end has basic features of social media like 
    *Register User
    *Login/Authenticate User
    *Create/update profile fields
    *Create/Delete posts
    *Add/remove likes
    *Add/remove comments to posts
    
All routes are tested via Postman
